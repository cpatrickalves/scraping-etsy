It easily takes poses and holds them. \u2022 The Fox can turn around, put the head low down as in the direct as in the side positions thanks to a double neck joint. \u2022 The body consists of 5 items, which allows it to arch the back, to fold (almost) a ball and turn to the side (see the photos). \u2022 Long and slender legs not only help the Fox to run fast and to dig burrows, but also to scratch behind the ear and close his eyes. \u2022 We make a special attention on the tail of the doll. It has a very attractive shape, that giving the feeling of fluffiness and volume. \u2022 An elegant nose makes a character face. \u2022 We have achieved a new, more intense ginger color, which we will use for all of the Fox dolls. When we played with the fox we understood that we didn't want to let it go from our hands! The sizes for adult fox are measured at the withers! And for comparison, an adult Fox of 5.5 cm at the withers looks like a teenager next to a Fox cub of 4,5 cm (for cubs the size is measured from the ground to the top of the ears). If you want to \"collect\" family, we recommend the adult fox of 7.5 cm is for the fox cub of 4,5 cm.
